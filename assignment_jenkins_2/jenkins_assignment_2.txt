Part 1
There is an organization which has 3 teams based on user roles : 
            - Developer
            - DevOps
            - Testing
        
First, you need to create 9 Jenkins jobs. Each job will print its job name, and build number.
            For the Developer, create 3 dummy jobs, visible in the developer view
                job1:- dev-1
                job2:- dev-2
                job3:- dev-3
            For Testing, create 3 dummy jobs, visible in the testing view
                job1:- test-1
                job2:- test-2
                job3:- test-3
            For DevOps, create 3 dummy jobs, visible in the devops view
                job1:- devops-1
                job2:- devops-2
                job3:- devops-3

Users in each team: 
            developer: [ They can see only dev jobs, can build it, see workspace and configure it ]
                - developer-1 
                - developer-2 
            testing: [ They can see all test jobs, can build it, see workspace and can configure it, | They can also view dev jobs ]
                - testing-1 
                - testing-2 
            devops:  [ They can see all devops jobs, can build it, see workspace and can configure it, | They can also view dev and test jobs  ]
                - devops-1 
                - devops-2
            Administration
                -  admin-1 [ It will have full access ]
